	// Find out if the user has the role already. If so, abort.
	// If user doesn't, then find the role in the guild, and use
	//       GuildMemberRoleAdd to add the role to the user
	// Only do this if the user has the money to do so, and make sure the money is
	//       deducted from the user's account, the purchase is added to their shop
	//       account, and everything is successfully saved. If necessary, it can be
	//       recovered if the role assignment were to fail. Or wait for the role
	//       assignment to succeed, then save the money & the purchase and, if it
	//       failed, then remove both.

	// Make sure the bot has the  MANAGE_ROLES permission in settings & make sure it is activated
	// To tell if a user has a role, get the guild member, then check the Roles slice.
